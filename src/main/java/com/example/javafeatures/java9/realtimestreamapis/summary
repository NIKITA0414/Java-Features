Explanation

-takeWhile: This method takes orders until it encounters one that does not meet
the condition (total amount > 100). In this example, it will continue taking orders until it
finds one that is not eligible.

-dropWhile: This method drops orders while they meet the condition (total amount > 100).
It stops dropping once it encounters an order that does not meet the condition.

-ofNullable: Demonstrates how to handle nullable values elegantly.
If the order is null, it creates an empty stream.

-iterate with a Predicate: Generates a stream of integers from 1 to 10,
demonstrating the new capability to specify a termination condition.
