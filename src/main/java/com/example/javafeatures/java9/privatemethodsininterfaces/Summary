*Private methods in Interfaces*

Summary: Java 9 introduced private methods in interfaces, allowing common code to be shared
between default methods without exposing that code to implementing classes.
This enhances code organization and reduces duplication.

-Private Method: The formatMessage method is defined as private within the interface,
allowing it to be used by the default method without being accessible outside.
-Default Method: The printMessage method calls the private formatMessage to format the message before printing.
-Implementation: The MyClass implements the interface but does not need to override the default method.
 When called, it uses the private method for formatting.
