*forEach() Method in Iterable Interface*

Summary: The forEach() method is a default method in the Iterable interface that allows you to iterate over
elements using a lambda expression. It provides a more concise and readable way to traverse collections.

*Java Time API*

Summary: The Java Time API (java.time package) was introduced to replace the older java.util.Date
and java.util.Calendar classes.It provides a comprehensive and user-friendly approach to handling dates and times,
supporting various operations like date manipulation and formatting.

*Java Stream API*

The Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, allows for functional-style operations on collections of data.
It provides a powerful way to process sequences of elements (like lists, sets, etc.) in a declarative manner.
Streams support various operations, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, enabling more concise and readable code.

Key Features
Laziness: Streams are computed lazily, meaning computations are deferred until necessary.
Parallel Processing: Streams can be processed in parallel, taking advantage of multicore architectures.
Functional Operations: Operations are expressed in a functional style, making code cleaner and more expressive.

*Utility Methods in the Math Class (Java 8)*
The Math class in Java provides various utility methods for performing basic numeric operations,
including calculations for trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, and more.
These methods are static, meaning they can be called without creating an instance of the Math class.

Key Utility Methods
Math.abs(x): Returns the absolute value of x.
Math.max(a, b): Returns the greater of two values.
Math.min(a, b): Returns the lesser of two values.
Math.sqrt(x): Returns the square root of x.
Math.pow(a, b): Returns a raised to the power of b
