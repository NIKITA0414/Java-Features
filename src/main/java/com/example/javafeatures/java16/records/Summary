Records in Java 16

Records are a feature in Java (since JDK 16) for creating simple, immutable data classes.

Key Points:

Immutability: Once created, the values can't change.
Concise Syntax: You define a record in one line, like record Point(double x, double y) {}.
Automatic Methods: Records automatically provide methods for comparing (equals), generating hash codes (hashCode),
 and converting to strings (toString).
