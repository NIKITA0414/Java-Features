*Day Period Support (JDK-8247781)*
LocalTime Creation: We create a LocalTime instance by parsing a time string.

DateTimeFormatter: We define a DateTimeFormatter with the pattern "h B",
                    where "h" represents the hour (1-12) and "B" provides the period of the day.

Formatting: We format the LocalTime instance using the formatter,
            which converts the time into a more descriptive string.

Output: Finally, we print the formatted time. For the example given, it would output "3 in the afternoon".

*Add Stream.toList Method (JDK-8180352)*
Input Data: We create a list of strings that represent integers.

Old Approach: We convert the strings to integers using the traditional approach with Collectors.toList(). This involves mapping each string to an integer and collecting the results into a list.

New Approach: We achieve the same result using the new Stream.toList() method, which is more concise and readable.

Output: Both approaches produce the same output, demonstrating that the new method simplifies the code.

*Pattern Matching for instanceof (JEP 394)*

^Traditional Check^:
The code checks if obj is an instance of String. If true, it casts obj to String using (String) obj to use String methods.

^Pattern Matching Check^:
                                                                                           The new syntax if (obj instanceof String str) checks the type and simultaneously binds obj to the variable str.
                                                                                           This eliminates the need for a separate cast, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.
