Stream API introduced two significant features:

.toList() Method: This method collects stream elements into an unmodifiable List, offering a convenient
alternative to collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList()). It emphasizes potential future optimizations,
 particularly for value-based lists.

mapMulti Family of Methods: These methods allow you to push multiple elements to a consumer instead of returning
a stream to be flattened. This is more efficient than using flatMap for situations where you expand a few elements.
 Variants like mapMultiToInt, mapMultiToLong, and mapMultiToDouble facilitate working with primitive streams directly.
